# Quantum_Hackathon_2021
Repository containing notebooks and scripts used for EPFL Quantum Hackathon (Nov 19th-20th 2021)

Welcome to the EPFL Quantum Hackathon repository!

This hackathon is the first initiative organized exclusively by students to gather students from European universities to work on quantum computing applications.
The theme adopted this year focuses on applications in quantum simulation. All the notebooks are written to be compatible with Qiskit (https://qiskit.org/) modules.
In this repository, you will find notebooks and code templates to be completed during the hackathon.

The coding exercises are sorted in two categories:
1. Guided exercises: in this folder, you will find a series of notebooks (QAOA, VQE, NESS, P-VQD) that require completion based on elements learnt in the lectures or in the polycopi√©.
2. Open exercises: Designed to give you more freedom in the way of realizing the tasks, those exercises rely on the theoretical content developed in previous notebooks, while offering more challenge in the approach taken.
   Feel free to take a look at the latest litterature to find ideas for helping you in the implementation.

Each team can issue a Pull Request on this repo once the exercises have been completed.
The code should be commented out as possible to make it readable for correction. The evaluation will be done according to a few criteria:
- Level of completion: We don't expect you to complete all the available content, we have given options and challenges to everyone according to their background and their will to learn new content. Guided exercises should be completed in priority before moving to open exercises.
- Quality of the code: Commented code and optimization is appreciated
- Presentation of the results: The goal of this hackathon is to bring people from different background and experience to the same table. Each one should take a particular insight on the exercises proposed. We encourage each team to prepare a presentation of their learning outcomes, as well as the results derived while implementing the algorithms (you can describe main bottlenecks or challenges related to a specific algorithm and think about potential solutions).

For any questions during the hackathon, feel free to reach out your TAs, or ask directly to the rest of the community on our Slack channel, under the thread #Hackathon2021.
You can also reach the committee of the EPFL Quantum Computing Association at quantum@epfl.ch

Have fun!
